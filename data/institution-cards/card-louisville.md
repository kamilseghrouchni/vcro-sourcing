### 5. People

| Name | Role | Affiliation |
|---|---|---|
| Julio A. Ramirez | PI, senior author across all anchor + sibling papers | U of L Division of Infectious Diseases |
| Stephen Furmanek | Senior co-author, operational lead | U of L |
| Forest Arnold | Co-investigator | U of L |

15+ distinct first authors across the sibling network — confirms PI controls access but actively delegates / collaborates. *"One phone call, but the call gets answered."*

### 6. Reuse / external-access track record

**Strongest signal:** [PMC7414893](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7414893/) (2020) — multi-omics on stored urine. Author list includes **Pierre, Akbilgic, Smallwood, Cao, Fitzpatrick, Jonsson** — affiliations outside Louisville. Hard evidence biospecimens cross institutional boundaries, not just that they exist.

**Publication velocity:** ~2–3 papers/year off this cohort over 10+ years. Healthy. Trends to 0 would signal dormancy.

**Self-criticism as quality signal:** [PMC10163290](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10163290/) reports NP swabs alone underdetect RSV. [PMC10124648](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10124648/) reports C. diff misdiagnoses. Same group publishing negative findings about their own diagnostics is rare and credible.

**Pre-curated subgroups already shipped as analyses:** COPD, ICH, T2D, SARS-CoV-2, RSV, GBS, C. diff. The cohort isn't a raw dump — curated slices are ready to hand off.

### 7. Access path

| Step | Detail |
|---|---|
| Direct contact | Julio A. Ramirez or Stephen Furmanek, U of L Division of Infectious Diseases |
| Steward institution | University of Louisville School of Medicine |
| IRB | U of L Human Subjects Research Protection Program (# 11.0613, # 13.0408 cover the existing protocol) |
| Required additional gates | Each of 9 participating hospitals approved separately — secondary-use scope outside CAP requires fresh protocol amendment |
| Decision authority | PI (Ramirez group) controls bank + database; track record of releasing externally |
| Data delivery | Paper CRF → web DB hosted by U of L Division of ID. **Not direct EHR pipe.** |

### 9. What we don't know

- Exact current N or whether enrollment is still active in 2026 (likely yes, not confirmed)
- Residual aliquot volumes per patient
- Freezer inventory / current usable specimen count
- Whether biospecimens are released to external requesters under what terms (pricing, DUA template)
- IRB scope for secondary use beyond pneumonia
- Linkage to claims, mortality registry, or longitudinal EHR pull
- Whether non-CAP admissions at U of L Hospital are similarly catalogued (this cohort is CAP-only)
- Ownership: U of L Hospital vs U of L School of Medicine vs Norton Healthcare (Louisville's main co-enrolling system)

These are the questions a first call answers — not the questions the page should pretend to answer.

### 10. How we found this

- **Method:** paperclip (PMC + bioRxiv + medRxiv) two-stage probe — anchor paper + sibling sweep
- **Anchor query:** PubMed search anchored on "University of Louisville Pneumonia Study Group" + Ramirez authorship
- **Sibling sweep:** ~15 metadata reads + 2–3 full reads
- **Confidence band:** **High** — protocol fully extractable from anchor + supplement; reuse confirmed by external-author paper; 10-year publication velocity confirms liveness
- **Probe state classification:** `cohort_present_and_stewarded_locally`
